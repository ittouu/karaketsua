How to use Encoder
==========================

The encoder class is entirely static and cannot be simpler to use.

At any point in any script, if you want to encode a string using MD5 simply call
	Encoder.MD5
	
Remember, though, strings encoded with MD5 cannot be decoded again!

To encode strings using Base64 or to decode them back again, simply use
	Encoder.Base64Encode 
or	Encoder.Baser64Decoder respectively.

That is all there is to it...

CML Function List
-----------------
static public string MD5 (string str)
static public string Base64Encode(string source) {
static public string Base64Decode(string source) {
