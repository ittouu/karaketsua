How to use GUIX
==========================

GUIX is a static class and does not need to be placed on a game object in your scene.
Just have it in your project and you are ready to use it.

It really cannot be easier to use! By default it will use the iPad retina's display size
but if you want to default to something else, simply call SetScreenSize once in any script
and all scripts will use the new resolution from there on in.

To use, simply call GUIX.FixScreenSize() with no paramters inside your OnGUI function.
That's it. That is all you have to do. If for some or other reason you want to get back to
the actual screen size, simply call GUIX.ResetDisplay() with no parameters. Done.

It really can't be easier.

The only thing to remember is that you MUST set the resolution to a size that Unity supports.
i.e. GUIX.SetScreenSize(960,640) is valid...
	 GUIX.SetScreenSize(212, 493) is not....

See GUIXTest.cs for a practical example.
