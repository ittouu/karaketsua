How to use StatusMessage
========================
The purpose of this class is to show errors and warnings on screen. It is mostly hardcoded
to allow for the look to remain constant.

To use, just start using it and it will automatically create a gameobject for itself and
make sure there is only one instance of the script in the game. If you are making a mobile game
and do not want to add an extra OnGUI call to your project, simply comment out the OnGUI function
and call StatusMessage.Instance.Draw() inside your existing OnGUI functions. Make sure to call
it as the last line of code in your OnGUI function so it appears on top of anything else you might
have on screen.

If you place the script on a game object directly, you can also specify the GUISkin to use but
I recommend placing it on an empty GameObject as the object it is placed on will not be destroyed
as you change sceens.

To show a message on screen, simply set the message like so:
	StatusMessage.Message = "Some message to show";
	
The message will be added on top of any existing message(s) and will display for 3 seconds.

It really is THAT simple.

Example use: See StatusMessageTest.cs
