How to use PleaseWait
==========================

Please wait was created to display a rotating image in the center of the screen.

It is completely automated so you can just start using it by calling PleaseWait.Draw()
but you also have theoption of creating a prefab and dropping the PleaseWait component onto it.

If you create a prefab, you an specify an image of your own choice to use as the spinner otherwise
the component will look for an image called Spinner inside a Resources folder. If the spinner is
not defined then the class will do nothing so make sure you either define one in a prefab or have
an image called Spinner inside a resources folder. This is the only requirement for this code to work.

When creating a prefab you can configure the class via the inspector but you also have the option of
setting the variables via code. The fields are all optional but should you wish to set them you can
do so via the exposed static functions meaning you can do it from anywhere in any script and don't have
to first link to the prefab.

See PleaseWaitTest.cs for a practical example.
